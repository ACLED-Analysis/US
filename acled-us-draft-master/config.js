Mass shootings hit a record high last year, violent hate crimes are on the rise, and police killings continue unabated. The COVID-19 pandemic has killed thousands and disrupted the economy, while George Floyd’s death in police custody has sparked a massive wave of protest across the country.<br><br>Despite these indicators, there have been no initiatives to collect comprehensive data on both political violence and demonstrations in the United States —  until now. <br><br>The <a href="https://acleddata.com/special-projects/us-crisis-monitor/" target="_blank">US Crisis Monitor</a>— a joint project between the <a href="https://acleddata.com/" target="_blank">Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED)</a> and the <a href="https://bridgingdivides.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">Bridging Divides Initiative (BDI) at Princeton University</a>— tracks these trends in real time. Making all data available to the public, the project aims to empower local communities by facilitating efforts to map, assess, and mitigate the risk of political violence around the country.<br><br>The data reveal that the United States is in crisis. It faces a multitude of concurrent, overlapping risks — from police abuse and racial injustice, to pandemic-related unrest and beyond — all exacerbated by increasing polarization.<br><br><center><i>The US Crisis Monitor is made possible by support from the Bridging Divides Initiative at the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs’ Liechtenstein Institute on Self-Determination.</i></center>',

In May, the killing of George Floyd by police triggered a massive protest movement — and a nationwide reckoning with racial inequality and police brutality.<br><br>On May 25, Minneapolis police officers arrested George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, for allegedly using a counterfeit $20 bill. One officer pinned Floyd to the ground and kneeled on his neck for eight minutes and 15 seconds, killing him. Other officers looked on.<br><br>Floyd’s death prompted a huge surge of demonstrations associated with the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement that quickly spread from Minneapolis throughout the country <i>(see inset graph)</i>. Between May 26, the day after Floyd’s death, and August 22, ACLED records over 7,750 demonstrations linked to  the BLM movement across more than 2,440 locations in all 50 states and Washington, DC.<br><br>The demonstrations remain ongoing. Though reported events associated with the BLM movement have gradually declined since their peak in late May and early June, ACLED still continues to record dozens of demonstrations each week <i>(see inset graph)</i>.',

            description: 'In the immediate aftermath of Floyd’s killing, President Donald Trump posted a series of social media messages threatening to deploy the military and National Guard to disperse demonstrations, suggesting that authorities should use lethal force if demonstrators engage in looting. The president called governors “weak” for allowing demonstrations in their states and instructed them to call in the National Guard to “dominate” and “cut through [protesters] like butter.” Senator Tom Cotton from Arkansas, an advisor to the president, recommended that the administration “send in the troops” and give “no quarter for insurrectionists, anarchists, rioters, and looters.”<br><br>Rhetoric soon translated to action: by the end of June, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) established the Protecting American Communities Task Force (PACT) and deployed agents around the country, including in Seattle, Washington. Since Floyd’s killing, ACLED records over 55 federal and National Guard deployments across the country, including members of PACT as well as forces affiliated with Operations Legend and Diligent Valor.<br><br>Seattle became an early hotspot of the protest movement and a target of the crackdown. Washington’s governor swiftly deployed the National Guard throughout the state and by Independence Day weekend the federal government sent agents assigned to PACT to guard monuments and to quell demonstrations. Demonstrators remained largely peaceful, but tensions rose as standoffs outside the Seattle Police Department’s East Precinct intermittently turned violent, with widespread use of tear gas, flashbang grenades, and pepper spray.<br><br>In early June, under pressure from elected officials raising allegations of excessive force, police withdrew from the East Precinct and demonstrators established a protest encampment they called the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest (CHOP) zone, independent of police and government control. While CHOP was marred by criminal violence, the creation of the encampment coincided with a lull in violent demonstrations. Although riots were reported before June 8 (when CHOP was established) and after July 1 (when it was dismantled), only peaceful protests were recorded during the intervening period <i>(see inset graph)</i>.<br><br>Authorities cleared CHOP and arrested dozens of demonstrators by the start of July, but the episode set an important precedent: President Trump warned that protesters would be met with “serious force” if they attempted to replicate CHOP elsewhere in the country.',

            description: 'Despite the fact that demonstrations associated with the BLM movement have been overwhelmingly peaceful, more than 9% — or nearly one in 10 — have been met with government intervention, compared to 3% of all other demonstrations. Authorities have used force — such as firing less-lethal weapons like tear gas, rubber bullets, and pepper spray or beating demonstrators with batons — in over 54% of the demonstrations in which they have engaged.<br><br>This heavy-handed government response took center stage in Portland, Oregon where demonstrators have gathered daily since Floyd’s killing. Throughout June, demonstrators rallied outside the Multnomah County Justice Center and other prominent government sites in downtown Portland, sporadically clashing with the police who blanketed the city with tear gas and impact munitions. A federal judge soon issued a restraining order against the Portland Police Bureau, instructing it to limit the use of tear gas over concerns that its officers were employing excessive force against demonstrators and violating their Fourth Amendment rights. By the end of the month, the order was expanded to restrict the use of other less-lethal weaponry like rubber bullets, and Oregon state legislators passed a new law that mandated police warn protesters before firing tear gas. Demonstrations continued, but tensions cooled.<br><br>The situation changed in July, when PACT agents and other federal personnel took a more active role in the response as part of Operation Diligent Valor. Against the wishes of local officials, federal authorities began aggressively policing the demonstrations, using excessive force and arbitrarily detaining suspected protesters in unmarked vehicles.<br><br>Prior to the deployment of PACT at the start of July, approximately 8% of demonstrations in Oregon were met with state intervention, and authorities infrequently used force against demonstrators. Since July, however, nearly 28% of demonstrations have been met with intervention and force by government personnel. In Portland specifically, under 24% of demonstrations were met with state force before July. Since July, this figure has risen to 40% of all demonstrations <i>(see inset graph)</i>.<br><br>Although federal authorities were purportedly deployed to keep the peace, the move appears to have re-escalated tensions. Prior to the deployment, over 83% of demonstrations in Oregon were non-violent. Post-deployment, the percentage of violent demonstrations has risen from under 17% to over 42%, suggesting that the federal response has only aggravated unrest <i>(see inset graph)</i>. In Portland, violent demonstrations rose from 53% to nearly 62% of all events after federal agents arrived on the scene.<br><br>In late July, officials announced that federal agents would reduce their presence in Portland following talks between Governor Kate Brown and Vice President Mike Pence, but would remain on standby. Some reports indicate that the pullback has lowered tensions, but President Trump has warned that federal authorities will not fully leave Portland until local authorities “secure their city.” As of early September, the federal government began deputizing Oregon State Police to respond to demonstrations in Portland, in coordination with US Marshals, potentially signalling renewed federal intervention in the city.',

America has emerged as the new epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak. With only 4% of the world’s population, the US is estimated to have a quarter of confirmed cases, according to a CNN review of data from Johns Hopkins University. Thousands have died. <br><br>In America, the health crisis and the latest wave of demonstrations associated with BLM are intertwined. The current BLM protest movement has become one of the largest in US history in part because it erupted within a new socio-economic environment deeply disrupted by the pandemic. Research indicates that people who lost their jobs and livelihoods are more likely to participate in the protests, especially as the pandemic has left clear winners and losers in its wake. The “Strike for Black Lives” for example, is an effort to unite “the interconnected fights for racial and economic justice.” As part of this movement, essential workers have been protesting in remembrance of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Elijah McClain, and other Black people killed by police, while also calling for the Senate to pass the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions (HEROES) Act: a stimulus package to address the pandemic’s economic impact — which has hit some harder than others. The number of Black Americans working in front-line jobs impacted by the pandemic is disproportionately high, Black workers continue to earn less than their white counterparts and almost half of Black households are concerned with their ability to make rent on a monthly basis. According to the Brookings Institution, COVID-19 has now become the third largest cause of death amongst the Black population.<br><br>The economic fallout from the pandemic is devastating. According to the University of New Hampshire, all 50 states have experienced “extreme job loss,” and 43 have recorded losses “worse than in the Great Recession.” The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the pandemic will shrink the economy by approximately $8 trillion over the next decade. More than half of all businesses that closed due to lockdown measures have reportedly closed for good, and the country is now facing a mass eviction crisis — which is projected to disproportionately affect minority communities.<br><br>As the situation deteriorated over the summer, demonstrators took to the streets over all of these issues and more, protesting unemployment, evictions, and unsafe working conditions as well as school reopenings and mask mandates. The pandemic has not escaped politicization, with regular confrontations between demonstrators for and against lockdown restrictions, and support for social distancing measures often polarized along party lines. Since May 24, over 1,000 pandemic-related demonstrations have been reported in 47 states and Washington, DC, particularly in California, New York, Florida, and Texas. By early August, demonstrations connected to the pandemic surpassed demonstrations associated with the BLM movement for the first time in months <i>(see inset graph)</i>.',

Although some — including many parents — support the president’s call to reopen, the vast majority are opposed to in-person teaching, with participants arguing that it remains unsafe to return to the classroom. Several schools that already reopened were almost immediately forced to quarantine hundreds of students, compounding these worries. More than 330 demonstration events over school reopenings have been reported across 42 states in recent weeks <i>(see inset map)</i>, and they show few signs of stopping. So far, reports suggest that all have been peaceful and have faced no government intervention, though some have been met with counter-protesters.<br><br>The American Federation of Teachers and the Connecticut Education Association has been particularly active, organizing dozens of demonstrations across the state. Connecticut’s governor has continued to push for schools to reopen, but now says the state will not enforce in-person teaching, delegating the ultimate decision to local officials. Many of the state’s smaller cities have indicated that public health resources are already stretched thin, and that their healthcare systems could be overwhelmed by a botched reopening.',

            description: 'The country is simultaneously facing a looming eviction crisis. Due to the pandemic’s economic impact, millions of Americans have fallen behind on rent payments. The COVID-19 Eviction Defense Project suggests that “19 to 23 million — or 1 in 5 — people living in renter households are at risk of eviction by October.” According to Princeton University’s Eviction Lab, evictions are likely to disproportionately affect the Black community.<br><br>While the government has held the crisis at bay through stimulus measures and both federal and state eviction moratoriums, the federal moratorium and a $600-a-week supplement to unemployment benefits lapsed at the end of July. Further relief negotiations between Democrats and Republicans have stalled in Congress over spending disagreements, prompting the president to sign executive orders extending the lapsed supplemental federal unemployment benefits, but reducing it to the $400-a-week. President Trump also made the plan contingent on states coming up with 25% of that payment, raising concerns that some states, already stretched thin financially during the pandemic, may opt out of the program. Trump’s executive action also does not reinstate the previous federal moratorium on evictions, but instead only directs federal agencies to “consider” measures to prevent evictions. The National Low Income Housing Coalition has called Trump’s order an “empty shell of a promise to renters.”<br><br>As the end of the notice period following the lapsed federal moratorium approached, demonstrations linked to the eviction crisis have broken out around the country — especially in the northeast, which has registered over one-third of these demonstrations.<br><br>Since May 24, at least 37 demonstrations have been reported across 15 states across the US <i>(see inset map)</i>. At the start of September, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a new nationwide moratorium on evictions through December. The policy has been welcomed as an “essential” step by housing advocates like the National Low Income Housing Coalition, though they remain concerned that “it is a half-measure that extends a financial cliff for renters to fall off of when the moratorium expires and back rent is owed.” While the move may stave off the eviction crisis and a surge in associated demonstrations for now, the threat is set to re-emerge by the end of the year.',

In August, for example, members of National Nurses United (NNU) held protests at healthcare facilities across the country as part of the “National Day of Action to Save Lives.” The nurses called on the Senate to pass the HEROES Act, a pending bill that the House of Representatives passed in May to provide $1 trillion in additional aid to states. They also demanded that hospitals adhere to CDC guidelines, provide adequate personal protective equipment, and take steps to prevent overwork. A recent survey conducted by NNU suggests that only 24% of nurses think they are provided with a safe workplace, while 87% indicate that they have had to reuse a single-use PPE at least once. Another 27% of nurses reported short-staffing.<br><br>ACLED records nearly 70 demonstrations involving healthcare workers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in 19 states and Washington, DC since May 24, with the highest concentration, by far, in California <i>(see inset map)</i> — the state with the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases.',

The administration has taken multiple steps to inflame these tensions, from announcing further federal deployments in “Democrat-led cities” like Chicago and Albuquerque to threatening a postponement of the election altogether. In this hyper-polarized environment, state forces are taking a more heavy-handed approach to dissent, non-state actors are becoming more active and assertive, and counter-demonstrators are looking to resolve their political disputes in the street.
